abstract="A key issue in sexual selection theory is how a correlation between male secondary sexual characters and male genetic quality can be maintained. The immunocompetence-handicap hypothesis proposes that testosterone-dependent male characters remain honest signals because of the immunosuppressive effect of elevated steroid hormone levels. The hypothesis requires that physiological levels of testosterone depress immune system function. We quantified testosterone titers and humoral immunocompetence of captive male and female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) at three points in the annual cycle (autumn, prebreeding, and breeding). We also conducted an implant experiment on the males to assess the effects of prolonged, above-normal testosterone titers on humoral immune responses. Humoral immunocompetence was measured as secondary antibody production to a non-pathogenic protein antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we developed for A. phoeniceus. Secondary antibody responses of individuals were highly repeatable between sampling periods. Neither physiological nor above-normal levels of plasma testosterone suppressed secondary antibody production. In paired tests of the same individuals between prebreeding and breeding, and between breeding and implant, plasma testosterone increased significantly but secondary antibody responses were unaffected. We are confident in these results because with 80{\%} power, an 11--14{\%} difference in antibody titers would have been detected. There was no relationship between plasma testosterone levels and humoral immunocompetence in free-ranging males tested at the peak of breeding. These results cast doubt on a key assumption of the immunocompetence-handicap hypothesis.",

	abstract = {We used implanted miniature data loggers to measure brain (in or near the hypothalamus) and carotid arterial blood temperatures at 5 min intervals in six free-ranging ostriches Struthio camelus in their natural habitat, for a period of up to 14 days. Carotid blood temperature exhibited a large amplitude (3.0{\textendash}4.6{\textdegree}C) circadian rhythm, and was positively correlated with air temperature. During the day, brain temperature exceeded carotid blood temperature by approx. 0.4{\textdegree}C, but there were episodes when brain temperature was lowered below blood temperature. Selective brain cooling, however, was not present in all ostriches, and was not tightly coupled to the prevailing body temperature. Brain temperature was maintained within narrow daily limits of approx. 2{\textdegree}C, and varied significantly less than blood temperature at short time scales of 5 to 20 min. At night, brain temperature exceeded blood temperature by as much as 3{\textdegree}C. We attribute the elevated brain temperatures to warming of cerebral arterial blood, by reduced heat exchange in the ophthalmic rete or possibly heat gain from cranial structures, before supplying the hypothalamus. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the significance of such variations in brain temperature and the importance of selective brain cooling in free-living birds.},

The response of the human circadian clock to extraocular light exposure was monitored by measurement of body temperature and melatonin concentrations throughout the circadian cycle before and after light pulses presented to the popliteal region (behind the knee). A systematic relation was found between the timing of the light pulse and the magnitude and direction of phase shifts, resulting in the generation of a phase response curve. These findings challenge the belief that mammals are incapable of extraretinal circadian phototransduction and have implications for the development of more effective treatments for sleep and circadian rhythm disorders.},

	abstract = {Metapopulation theory provides a framework for understanding population persistence in fragmented landscapes and as such has been widely used in conservation biology to inform management of fragmented populations. However, classical metapopulation theory [Levins, R. (1970) Lect. Notes Math. 2, 75-107] ignores metapopulation structure and local population dynamics, both of which may affect extinction dynamics. Here, we investigate metapopulation dynamics in populations that are subject to different migration rates by using experimental metapopulations of the annual plant Cardamine pensylvanica. As predicted by classical metapopulation theory, connected populations persisted longer than did isolated populations, but the relationship between migration and persistence time was nonlinear. Extinction risk sharply increased as the distance between local populations increased above a threshold value that was consistent with stochastic simulations and calculation of metapopulation capacity [Hanski, I. \&amp; Ovaskainen, O. (2000) Nature 404, 755-758]. In addition, the most connected metapopulations did not have the highest persistence levels. Stochastic simulations indicated an increase in extinction risk with the highest migration rates. Moreover, calculation of population coherence [Earn, D. J. D., Levin, S. A. \&amp; Rohani, P. (2000) Science 290, 1360-1364], a metric that predicts synchronous cycles, indicated that continuous populations should cycle in phase, resulting in an increased extinction risk. Determining empirically the optimal migration level to improve survival chances will be challenging for any natural population. Migration rates that would not increase migration above the threshold value would be ineffectual, but migration rates that would homogenize local densities could increase the risk of coherent oscillations and enhance extinction risk.},
